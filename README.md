# About

The scope of this project is to implement a simple WebApp that will contain an API for each of my ML Projects so that I can use all of them at the same time without too much of a hussle.

## Known Issues

When using any of the functions, it generates a new src link for the files, however the browser uses the variant from the cache, resulting in it not properly updating.
